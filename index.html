    <em><b>Introduction to Programming</b></em>
<br>
<br>
<p>The <b>internet</b> is probably one of the most fascinating things ever created. One can find anything at anytime and even more than that the internet connects people from anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>The <em>Internet</em> has two faces: the one that we see, with beautiful made and websites and easy to work with and the one that we don't see. The face that we don't see is a bunch of written text that is called <b>HTML language</b>. So everything on the internet is made up of <em><b>documents written in HTML</b></em>. </p>
<br><p>HTML, known as <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> is the language that computers understand. And all the HTML documents are connected on the internet thruough <b><em>Hyperlinks</em></b>. </p>
<br><em><b>TAGS AND ELEMENTS</b></em>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>HTML</b> language contains elements that are each defined by <b><em>tags</em></b>. When we write HTML code, <b>tags</b> help us tell computers what each element represents.</p>
<br>
In HTML language, elements can be either <em><b>Inline</b></em> or <em><b>Block</b></em>.
<br>The <b>inline</b> elements appear in a straight line and the <b>block</b> elements have an invisible block around them.
